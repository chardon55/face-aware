# Face Aware

A solution of face scoring (or "测颜值" in Mandarin) using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

Written in Python in January 2021.

Due to the hardware restrictions, the models were as simple as demos.

This repository does not contain dataset, since it is too large (over 11 GiB).

The models were used in Faceval.
