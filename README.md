# Face Aware

A solution of face scoring (or "测颜值" in Mandarin) using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

Written in Python in January 2021.

Due to the hardware restrictions, the models were as simple as demos (so to speak🙊).

This repository does not contain dataset, since it is too large (over 11 GiB).

The models were used in Faceval.
